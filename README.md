@mahesh kokare : points to work with new schema on backend side 

1. max profit and loss of the day for each strategy
2. add a field for strategy name
3. how many lots or quantity field missing , in this we buy show (25) and if we sell show (-25) which makes more sense
4. which option is currently executed up and running 
5. start date and end date field for each strike
6. remove 2 field of symbol and nfo type : 1 field with suffix banknifty_option or banknifty_futures can work 
7. in action if we buy PE show buy instead of sell , which miss lead nows . when we short then we can show sell . 


@sandeep kokare . make it more user friendly
frontend side :
1. filter based on strategy and more fields based on option or futures
2. current position and history position to display based on checkbox .
3.
